# Kubernetes Core Concepts
Below i wud be writing about the core concepts one by one.

## Kubernetes Namespace
In Linux, we use the namespace which helps in isolating the processes from one another. Similary, in kubernetes we have ns which can provide a scope for object names.
* Kubernetes uses the namespaces to organize objects inside a cluster, we can think of these like folders holding different objects that perform strict resource separation. 
* By default, kubectl cmd line tool interacts with default namespace.
* We can also list all namespace using --all or specific with its name.

Multiple Namspaces helps in splitting complex systems with multiple components into smaller separate groups.
