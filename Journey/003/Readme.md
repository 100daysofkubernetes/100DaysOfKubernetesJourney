# More reading and planning for some edits to Pac-Man NodeJS app

## Introduction
So I use this Pac-Man app quite a lot for demos. Recently I updated it with some more security out of the box. Now looking to improve the NodeJS itself

## Prerequisite
[Pac-Man for Kubernetes](https://github.com/saintdle/pacman-tanzu)

## Use Case
Improve the NodeJS - researched the other forks of [this application](https://github.com/font/pacman) to understand what is going on under the hood.
