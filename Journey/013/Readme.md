# Working with TMC API and some container file fixes - YouTube videos and a podcast recording starring me!

## Introduction
Fixed a [YAML issue](https://github.com/saintdle/pacman-tanzu/commit/0f153de3554d202e3996c485743f43272d7191f8) with my Pac-man application where by I'd removed a line break.

I've continued to work on understanding the Tanzu Mission Control API as well, and building out my various pieces for us with my vRA pipelines, and adding clusters into TMC once they are deployed.
