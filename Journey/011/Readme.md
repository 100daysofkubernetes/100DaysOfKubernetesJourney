# Runecast Analyzer for Kubernetes - KubeCon wrap up reading

## Introduction
I reached out to [Kev Johnson](https://twitter.com/kev_johnson) from Runecast, so that I could deploy their tool and analyze a Kubernetes cluster. [Runecast implements](https://www.runecast.com/blog/runecast-analyzer-4-5-introduces-kubernetes-best-practices-security-checks) checks against the [CIS Benchmark for Kubernetes](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/kubernetes/). I did actually find an issue with their deployment in my lab, Kev connected me to one of their engineers to look into it and help resolve. I believe this made them rethink their Helm Chart configuration too. Great service especially as I was just poking around at the software. 

Runecast have a great solution for monitoring complaince in your environment for a number of your platforms, and they are rapidly expanding to additional platorms as well.

Kubecon finished a few days ago, but I've not even scratched the surface and there's too much I need to go back and watch, or watch again!
