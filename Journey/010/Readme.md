# Postman lost my work - Understanding JSON Path - General Kubernetes reading

## Introduction
I like to use Postman when I'm working with APIs for the time for new applications, it makes it easy for me to design my API calls, test and validate. I finally decided to take note of the reminder and sign into the Postman app. But then all of a sudden all of my existing work just disappeared. I was massively worried. I'd being building a new collection. Luckily I found a fix you can read below. 

I also started to play around with JSON path, so when querying against an API for example, I can output just the information I want.

  - Make your Kubectl output look pretty with [Kubecolour](https://github.com/dty1er/kubecolor)
    - kubecolor colorizes your kubectl command output and does nothing else. kubecolor internally calls kubectl command and try to colorizes the output so you can use kubecolor as a complete alternative of kubectl.
