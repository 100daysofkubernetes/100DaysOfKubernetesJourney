# Something new using the same idea! Deploy Azure AKS clusters using vRA

## Introduction
So after getting things working with AWS, I decided to quickly turn things around to focusing on Microsoft Azure and AKS clusters. 

Essentiallly for this one, after testing the [official Azure CLI docker image](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/blob/dev/Dockerfile), I decided I didn't need to build my own. 

I did add some extra bits into this work and understand how I can grab the SSH keys generated by the Azure CLI command line for the AKS deployment, from the container where the tasks run in vRA.
